# Gamification in Economics: Normal-form Games 

In this repository we present a general implementation of several Normal-form Games (2 Players) using the public version of OTree Code (https://github.com/oTree-org/oTree), realised within the ZHAW project about "Gamification in Economics"
The available templates are available for games with:
- 2x2 Strategies
- 3x3 Strategies
- 2x3 Strategies

Multiplayers are supported, as long as they can be grouped in 2-players groups.
 
A list of user-defined parameters of the game include:
- Game's name
- Number of repetitions
- Strategy names
- Images and pdf instructions for the game
- Payoffs
- Communication among players

The payoffs can be changed manually or setup according to normal or uniform distributions (the parameters of the distributions can also be defined by the user)
